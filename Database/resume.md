**Project**

**Bookinglet | May 2022 - Aug 2022**

A booking platform commercial website for small business. Merchants can create stores/services, set details and schedules for them, and view order status. Customers can register, retrieve stores, book services, view appointment status, etc. [Bookinglet](https://www.bookinglet.com.au/)

##### project architecture

- Designed system architecture, business function logic, user function logic.
- **Independently designed core algorithm** of entire project: calendar, reservation, booking,  synchronous update algorithms.

##### back-end and database

1. Developed **multi-condition cooperative search/sort/pagination function** for stores and orders.
2. Independently designed and developed **calendar & reservation infomation storage system algorithm and functions** for stores/services/bookingRecords.
3. Independently designed and developed **booking decision tree algorithm and functions**.
4. Independently designed and developed **synchronous update mechanism** for services and its booking records, which allows changes in service calendar can affect existing booking records documents.
5. Built basic CRUD services for users, stores, services, categories, **provided customized functions** for these tables according to system requirement.
6. **Developed routes, controllers and middlewares** to cooperate with above services.
7. **Developed error handleing middlewares** for entire back-end system.
8. Built **Joi validation** schemas to verify back-end input data. 
9. **Independent designed and built database** for entire project by **using Mongodb**, including users/stores/services/bookingRecords/categories/orders.
10. Using **Swagger** to build RESTful APIs document for front-end and back-end docking.

##### Front-end and UI

1. Developed pages for store management and business setting, including project core: **store calendar and serviceInfo calendar**. The stack used includes **React, Redux Toolkit, Styled Component, MUI, React-toastify, added responsive support**. **The calendar system is custom designed and no third party library is used**.
2. Designed costomer booking page, including **booking time and duration locking and display algorithm**, developed store booking information visualization by using **Chart.js**.
3. Developed part of UI for Business setting page, customer booking page, customer booking order page.

**Others**

1. Helped other team members complete pages, modify bugs, and complete logic.

2. Review Pull Request(PR)s, answeing and solving technical issues from team and peers, setup and shared knowledge in Gather, motivated members in the team.

   

**Passive radar signal processing (constant false alarm rate) | Jul 2017 - Jul 2018**

Design and implement the filtering algorithm of passive passive radar, including software simulation and hardware implementation.

+ A project based on DSP (Digital Signal Processing) and FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) technology. Use the engineering process, design system and algorithm, and use the Matlab simulation to verify the algorithm. Afterwards, the software simulation is realized by using Verilog language, and the hardware is realized by FPGA circuit board.
